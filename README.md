This project involves developing a network packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. It displays relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.

Important Note: This packet sniffer is intended for educational purposes only. Ensure you have explicit permission to capture and analyze network traffic. Unauthorized use of packet sniffers can be illegal and unethical.
